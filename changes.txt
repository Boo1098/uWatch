uWatch Revisions:

1.0 - First Release

1.1
- Replaced EEPROM I2C routines

1.2
- Fixed bug in RPN plus, minus and X^Y modes

1.3
- Time mode display correctly after coming out of sleep mode
- PI in RPN mode now lifts stack
- RPN stack lift for decimal point first fixed
- ALG stack lift for decimal point first fixed
- negative exponent entry now doesn't override previous entry
- Yreg now displays corrrectly after sleep mode
- Setup mode menu now wraps correctly in backwards direction
- Calc stack is now preserved when changing modes

1.3.1 (voidware)
- removed sqrt < 0 = 42 hack
- revamped RPN input logic, mainly to reduce code.
- implemented non-integer factorial via gamma function
- clamp factorial at inf to avoid loop hang
- default to RPN
- changed the menu "X^Y" to "Y^X"
- reinstanted display of day of week (changed 4 digit year to 2).
- display the moon phase (currently as a letter)
- RPN clear clear did not work as expected.

1.3.2
- streamlined the time/date display calculation.
- do not redraw the time if not changed (might reduce flicker/save power?)
- Setup mode allow selection of Region
- Daylight saving time implemented by region or off if "NONE"
- DST regions supported:
  NONE, W.EU, C.EU, E.EU, Australia, USA, Canada.

1.3.3
- use even smaller MJD calculation
- rebased MJD from 2000/1/1 for 16 bit epoch (valid until 2179)
- moon phase for UI integer only.
- baseN conversion does not hang (although still not implemented)
- change menu "LOGe" to "Ln"
- change menu items to use lower case
- added time function ("sun" rise & set).
- added time functions ->H and HMS,
- increase number of digits displayed by 1.
- refactored 2digit input code for menus and selections.
- refactored menu drivers.
- totally changed RPN mode 
- calculator operations now driven from generic menus
- menu system expanded to have an "inv" or "2nd" page
- added DMY and ->D date arithmetic
- moved everything about on the menus! (there are currently some gaps)
- ALG mode operational again (needs more testing).
- changed setup menu "Location" to "DST Zone"
- setup "location" now enters longitude and latitude in HMS format.

1.3.4
- changed "inv" menus to "2nd"
- changed menu item "e^x" to "Exp"
- swapped LN and EXP (exp is more common).
- put Log10 and 10^x on page 1B.
- fix for display corruption
- change default LCD timeout to 45 seconds (was 1 min).
- bugfix: pressing +/- after input was broken

1.3.5
- eprom erase should use unsigned to display number.
- moon phase correction.

1.3.6 (merged with Rob F's code)
- Branch for base display modes ( binary, decimal, hex )
- Added a "Base" menu option to select base display mode
- displays up to 16 bit binary numbers
- displays up to 64 bit hex numbers
- non decimal modes are truncated for display; internal representation is untouched.
- EXP key in hex mode shows hex key menu

1.3.7
- fix for AM/PM indicator wrong during noon to 1pm.
- removed Conversions BASE-N (was incomplete and superseded by Rob's BASE mode).
- stack lift missing for; a ENT b OP '.' or 'e'. ie non-digit number entry.
- stack lift missing for; a ENT OP, then enter a number
- fixed: the +/- key does not properly negate a negative result from a previous calculation
- fixed: OP then +/- followed by number went back to entry.
- fixed after OP then clear +/- shows -0
- fixed: recalling values from storage registers overwrites the x register.
- removed delays from STO/RCL to avoid slowing down macro programs.
- added ABS function to menu.
- changed R>P and P>R so that X is the angle and Y is the arg.
- fixed: C or mode escapes from menu
- fixed: ALG mode did not even work properly. eg 3 + 4 * 2 / 2 went wrong!
- change ALG operator indicators P2R = 'r', R2P = 'p'
- fix screen corruption bug in ALG mode.
- display more digits when possible
- fix ALG mode bug with Y^X
- ALG parentheses limit reduced to 4.
- fixed, C doest not disable stack lift.
- right bracket is backspace key during number entry in RPN mode.

-- Experimental complex number support
- base 4 ops
- complex; X<>Y, ROLL, STO, RCL, 1/x, x^2, PI, ABS, SQRT, Y^X, Y^(1/X)
- complex: LOG, EXP, LOG10, 10^X
- complex: SIN, COS, TAN, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN
- entry of complex number using repeated '.' ie a second '.' is re-interpreted
  as the start of the imaginary part, unless an exponent exists, in which case
  a single '.' starts the i part.
- added REAL, C>R, R>C, CONJ to third menu 2nd page; real-part,
  split, join and conjugate.
- fixed +/- to change sign of number including complex part.
- remove leading 0 in 0.xyz to compact complex display.
- full mant display using Menu + mode
- fix alg mode for complex numbers
