uWatch Revisions:

1.0 - First Release

1.1
- Replaced EEPROM I2C routines

1.2
- Fixed bug in RPN plus, minus and X^Y modes

1.3
- Time mode display correctly after coming out of sleep mode
- PI in RPN mode now lifts stack
- RPN stack lift for decimal point first fixed
- ALG stack lift for decimal point first fixed
- negative exponent entry now doesn't override previous entry
- Yreg now displays corrrectly after sleep mode
- Setup mode menu now wraps correctly in backwards direction
- Calc stack is now preserved when changing modes

1.3.1 (voidware)
- removed sqrt < 0 = 42 hack
- revamped RPN input logic, mainly to reduce code.
- implemented non-integer factorial via gamma function
- clamp factorial at inf to avoid loop hang
- default to RPN
- changed the menu "X^Y" to "Y^X"
- reinstanted display of day of week (changed 4 digit year to 2).
- display the moon phase (currently as a letter)
- RPN clear clear did not work as expected.

1.3.2
- streamlined the time/date display calculation.
- do not redraw the time if not changed (might reduce flicker/save power?)
- Setup mode allow selection of Region
- Daylight saving time implemented by region or off if "NONE"
- DST regions supported:
  NONE, W.EU, C.EU, E.EU, Australia, USA, Canada.

1.3.3
- use even smaller MJD calculation
- rebased MJD from 2000/1/1 for 16 bit epoch (valid until 2179)
- moon phase for UI integer only.
- baseN conversion does not hang (although still not implemented)
- change menu "LOGe" to "Ln"
- change menu items to use lower case
- remove 3root from menu, replace with "Time" a new menu of time functions
- added time function ("sun" rise & set).
- added time functions ->H and HMS,
- increase number of digits displayed by 1.
- refactored 2digit input code for menus and selections.
- refactored menu drivers.
- totally changed RPN mode 
- calculator operations now driven from generic menus
- menu system expanded to have an "inv" or "2nd" page
- WaRNING: DISCONNECTED ALG MODE !!!! <- yes, i will put this back in
- added DMY and ->D date arithmetic
- moved everything about on the menus! (there are currently some gaps)
