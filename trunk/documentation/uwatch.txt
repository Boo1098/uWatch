
Notation and Navigation

[KEY] indicates the keyboard key with the labeling "KEY"
<KEY> indicates a conceptual key -- just for the purposes of this
documentation to make it more readable.  Where you see <OK> that means
press [ENTER], as clarified in this table...

<QUIT>  = [C]		exit without doing anything
<UP> 	= [)]  		up-scrolling is done by the right bracket key
<DOWN> 	= [MENU] 	down-scrolling is done by the menu key
<OK>    = [ENTER]	selection and exit from menus is done by the enter key

As you can see, these navigation keys occupy the right column of the keyboard.

For historical reasons, some of these key functions are also available on other
keys.  These alternate keys can become useful if your uWatch keyboard has a problem
with commonly used keys.

Here is a list of key alternates...

<OK>    = [ENTER] [(]
<UP>    = [)] [EXP] [-]
<DOWN>  = [MENU] [+] [+/-]

Although the keys do different things at different times, generally
you hit [MENU] to enable a menu and then <DOWN> (ie: [MENU] again) to scroll down the
items in the menu, or <UP> to scroll up the items in the menu.

Some items in the uWatch have a more logical <LEFT> and <RIGHT> meaning (e.g.: scrolling
to view wide string displays) so in these cases, <UP> = <LEFT> and <DOWN> = <RIGHT>.  In
these cases, it's more useful to use [EXP] as the <LEFT> key.

Here are some synonyms...

<UP> = <PREVIOUS> <LEFT>
<DOWN> = <NEXT> <RIGHT>

That is (for example), the [)] key can be used whenever (logically) you want to go to a previous item,
or move left, or go up.

These synonyms are for convenience, but all navigation can be done with the right column keys only;  that
is, [C], [)], [MENU] and [ENTER].

The [MODE] key

uWatch has three basic 'modes'...

TIME mode
CALCULATOR mode
APPLICATIONS mode

At any point, you can switch between modes using the [MODE] key.

The uWatch starts up in TIME mode. The uWatch is primarily a wristwatch, so the TIME mode is given priority
when the [MODE] key is pressed.  The first time you press [MODE] from either calculator or an application, the mode
will return to TIME mode.  Subsequent [MODE] presses will rotate through TIME/CALCULATOR/APPLICATIONS.

Menus
-----

To bring up a menu, press [MENU].  The menu title is generally shown on the
top line of the display, and menu options are shown on the bottom line of the
display.  Whenever mutliple menu options are available, the rightmost lower
character in the display displays two little arrows, pointing up and down. These
indicate that you can press <UP> or <DOWN> to display the menu options.

A menu item that begins with an arrow symbol (similar to '>') indicates that that item is
itself a menu containing other items.

Press <OK> to select the currently displayed menu item.

Press <C> to exit from the current menu without making a selection.


----
THE CALCULATOR
----

The uWatch has both algebraic and RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculators. RPN is the default type. The type of calculator may be changed from the Applications/Tools/Calculator menu. In the RPN calculator, functions apply
directly to the X and Y registers.  In the algebric calculator, functions may operate directly on the X register,
or require input of a second number after the function has been selected.  For example, when choosing 'nPr' function,

RPN:        [6] [ENTER] [3] [nPr]
Algebraic:  [6] [nPr] [3] [=]


Calculator Menus
----------------

The calculator menus operate slightly differently than menus in other areas of the UI. The calculator
uses function-key shortcuts to allow efficient selection of functions from menus.  Calculator menus are
activated by pressing [MENU], and each menu is shown as (up to) 6 functions on the screen (organised in
2 rows of 3 functions as shown in the figure). These functions can be selected by pressing a F-key shortcut.
The F-keys are marked F1 - F6 on the uWatch keyboard overlay.

    +-------------------+      +-------------------+
    |  sin   cos   tan  |      |   F1    F2    F3  |
    | sin-1 cos-1 tan-1 |      |   F4    F5    F6  |
    +-------------------+      +-------------------+
          display                  function key
    
In the trigonometry menu shown above left, 'cos' is selected by pressing F2 (the 8 key) as shown at right.

There are multiple calculator function menus. Each menu contains functions generally of the same
type (for example, statistics functions are grouped together into a single menu 'page').  You can
cycle through menu pages by pressing <UP> or <DOWN>.  The last-used menu 'page' is remembered next
time you press [MENU].

When you select a function (by pressing F1-F6), the corresponding menu function is processed.  If there
is no function displayed, the key will have no effect.  In the RPN calculator, calculator menu functions are
performed immediately.  In the algebraic calculator, operation may be immediate or delayed, depending on the
need for a second parameter (for example, nPr will require an 'r' value to be entered, followed by ENTER).

You can exit (cancel) the calculator menu witout performing any function by pressing <C>.

Bases
-----

Number bases 2, 8, 10 and 16 are supported.  The base is selected from the calculator menu page, where...

'bin'   is binary, base 2
'oct'   is octal, base 8
'dec'   is decimal, base 10 (DEFAULT)
'hex'   is hexadecimal, base 16

The current base (if not 10) is shown as a small subscript of the number displayed.

Numeric entry is in the currently selected base, so in binary (base 2) the available digits for number entry
are restricted to 0 and 1.  In octal, digits 0 to 7.  In decimal, digits 0 to 9, and in hexadecimal digits
0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'F'.  These letters are entered by pressing '.' and then using the F-key to
select the appropriate letter from the on-screen menu as shown below.

    +-------------------+
    |   A     B     C   |
    |   D     E     F   |
    +-------------------+

Viewing Wide Numbers
--------------------

Bases 2, 8 and 16 do not have fractional capability (that is, they operate on whole numbers only), and have a
maximum range of 64 bits (signed value). When the number of digits required to display a base-n number exceeds
16, the value's higher digits are truncated and the leftmost column of the display shows '<'. To view the
'wide' number, press <LEFT> to scroll/view the whole number.  This engages the 'view string' mode which allows
<LEFT> and <RIGHT> to scroll and view large strings.  Press <ENTER> or <C> to return to normal calculator
usage.

    +-------------------+
    |   A     B     C   |
    |<1234567890   D     E     F   |
    +-------------------+



Complex Numbers
---------------

There is no complex mode! the uwatch performs complex number operations when a
complex number is present and does not need to be set into a special mode for
this. The calculator's internal functions test for the presence of an ipart in
order to perform the best calculation. importantly, when there is no ipart,
the calculation is the same as for normal real numbers so it remains
efficient, fast and in some cases more stable numerically than the complex
version. So there is no loss of efficiency and precision by not having a mode.

However, the lack of a dedicated mode means that some real number calculations
can result in a complex answer. for example sqrt(-2) and acos(1.2).

Complex numbers are implemented using a parallel stack, so there are shadow
ipart registers for X, Y, Z and T (and also the 10 memories). A complex number
occupies a single line of display just as do the normal reals. Naturally,
there is less room to display the number on one line, so the number of digits
is shortened appropriately.

Entry Method
------------

Enter numbers in the usual way, and initiate the entry of an ipart by pressing
"." either once or twice. When a decimal dot or exponent is already present,
pressing "." will initate the ipart entry. the screen will change to, for
example, "1.2+i" waiting for the ipart entry. 

If there is no decimal place already, two "."s are required, for example, to
enter 1+i, enter "1..", you can leave it as +i or enter 1 if you like, both
are acceptable. for example "0.." enters the value "i" (ie 0+i).

The +/- change sign key can be used during the process of number entry to
affect the signs of number parts. Before EXP or "i" is entered, +/- changes
the sign of the mantissa, after EXP it changes the sign of exponent, after "i"
it changes the sign of the ipart and, lastly, after EXP again, changes the
sign of the ipart exponent (NOTE: a backspace key in RPN mode is planned to
help make corrections when entering long numbers).

Since the entry of a complex number can be longer than the 16 digits
displayed, the number will scroll left on entry accommodating the rightmost
digits (NOTE: you cannot currently scroll back before entry).

Full Mantissa Display Trick
---------------------------

You can display the full mantissa for both the real and iparts of a complex
number by pressing MENU then exit with MODE. The complex number is displayed
using both lines with the top line the real part and the bottom line the
ipart.

Note: this does not change anything on the stack and is just a display trick.

Functions supporting complex numbers
------------------------------------

* basic 4 ops (+ - * /)
* stack ops; ROLL, X<>Y, ENTER
* memory ops: RCL, STO
* 1/X, X^2, SQRT, ABS (modulus), Y^X, Y^(1/X)
* LN, EXP
* LN10, 10^X
* SIN, COS, TAN
* ASIN, ACOS, ATAN
* complex specific;

  C>R = split complex into X, Y registers
  R>C = combine X+iY into complex
  CONJ = complex conjugate.
  REAL = real part.

Functions not operating on complex numbers
------------------------------------------

* R->P, P->R  (always set ipart to 0) useful with C>R and R>C
* Factorial (gamma)
* complex BASE mode (!)
* // (parallel), should this do something clever with power etc?

Trig functions of complex numbers only makes sense in radians, but since there
is no complex mode, the angular mode cannot be ignored. consequently, a trig
function in DEG mode will apply to a complex number by converting it to
radians.

Since we are modeless, R>P and P>R cannot perform special case operations for
complex numbers (eg working with polar complex), so instead there are C>R
and R>C split and combine operations which separate a complex number into
two stack levels x & y and the reverse. like this, the complex number can be
operated as polar by performing; C>R R>P R>C

Also, the split is a useful way to see a complex number at full precision
(then use combine to put it back).

Philosophy behind the complex number support
--------------------------------------------

Some of the way in which the uWatch complex numbers work is different from
that on HP calculators. The calculators tend to have a complex number mode in
which some operations (eg P->R and R->P) work differently.

For the uWatch, i didnt want the complex number implementation to any way
interfere with the normal numeric operations. This is because complex numbers
are an advanced feature which many users will be unaware of, especially at
first.

The amount of time i read users posting on forums saying their 15c has a little
"c" on the screen and has gone into a mode where things work differently,
means that modes are confusing. It's really, really annoying when your
calculator/pda/phone etc. goes into a funny mode which works in a differnt way
and you're out in the field and dont have the manual and you dont know how to
get it back to normal. You wind up resetting the unit as a last resort!

There is also an argument that DEG/RAD should not be a mode. being in the
wrong angle mode has had me over in the past and i would guess it has been the
same for everyone else. However, the DEG/RAD mode is so ingrained and expected
that it would be wrong not to support it.

not having a complex mode creates a few problems. The uWatch cannot simply
look at the number to see if it has an ipart because the ipart may just happen
to be zero and it would be a mistake to operate with the number in different
way.

For example, the 15c R->P function converts a complex number into its angular
form when in complex mode, but operates on X & Y stack registers
otherwise. The uWatch cannot mimic this, so instead it offers functions to
split a complex into the X & Y registers (and another to combine them). In
this way P->R and R->P can always perform the same operation. To this effect,
they reset any residual ipart on X & Y.

CHESS:

The Display:

The chessboard display can be scrolled using <UP> and <DOWN>

The white pieces are drawn using a contrasting technique that may be controlled
by using the number keys [1] through [9].  The lower the number, the
blacker the white pieces appear.  The initial contrast level is "5".

<C> or <ENTER> will switch between move entry and board display.

In move entry, the last computer move (if any) is displayed on the top line.

Moves are entered using column number row number format.  For example,
5254 is E2-E4 equivalent.

Illegal moves return to the board display.  Legal moves trigger the
computer player to search for a reply.

When the computer moves, the board is displayed with the computer move
positioned on the top line of the display.  YOu may switch back and forth
between move entry and board display using <C> or <ENTER>

The game may be discontinued by pressing [MODE] from the board display.

When returning to chess, if a game was previously in progress, an option
to continue or start a new game is presented.
