
Notation

[KEY] indicates the keyboard key with the labeling "KEY"
<KEY> indicates a conceptual key -- just for the purposes of this
documentation to make it more readable.  Where you see <OK> that means
press [ENTER], as clarified in this table...

<QUIT>  = [C]		exit without doing anything
<UP> 	= [)]  		up-scrolling is done by the right bracket key
<DOWN> 	= [MENU] 	down-scrolling is done by the menu key
<OK>    = [ENTER]	selection and exit from menus is done by the enter key

As you can see, these navigation keys occupy the right column of the keyboard.

Although the keys do different things at different times, generally
you hit [MENU] to enable a menu and then [MENU] again to scroll down the
items in the menu.  But it's easier to think of as [MENU] <DOWN>

Navigation

Menus are available from:

TIME mode
CALCULATOR mode
APPLICATIONS mode

To bring up a menu, press [MENU].  The menu title is generally shown on the
top line of the display, and menu options are shown on the bottom line of the
display.  Whenever mutliple menu options are available, the rightmost lower
character in the display displays two little arrows, pointing up and down. These
indicate that you can press <UP> or <DOWN> to display the menu options.

A menu item that begins with an arrow > symbol indicates that that item is
itself a menu containing other items.

Press <OK> to select the currently displayed menu item.

Press <C> or [MODE] to exit from the current menu without making a selection.
<C> will return to the previous mode.
[MODE] will return to TIME mode. 

TIME MENU:

Menu available from TIME mode:

CLOCK
	Stopwatch
	Calendar
	> Setup
		Set Time
		Set Date
		Calibrate
		Set 12/24h
		Set DST Zone
		Set Location
		

In the above example, Setup is a sub-menu containing 6 items.

CALCULATOR MENU:

The calculator has a slightly different menu system, as it uses F-keys
to allow quick selection of functions.  When you press [MENU] in calculator
mode, you will see up to 6 functions displayed on the screen.  These are 
arranged in two lines of three, or two lines of two.

The F1 to F6 keys will select the function displayed in the similar relative
position of the F-key on the keyboard.

As with other menus, <UP> and <DOWN> will cycle through the available menus
and <C> or <OK> will quit with no action.

[MODE] will also return to the calculator.
