
* Here are the instructions for the Games

* Twenty One

To play just use the 1 and 2 keys as directed. Use the Enter key to proceed
when unsure. Press Mode at any time to quit back to time mode.

The aim of the game is to get a higher value than the dealer but not bust.
You bust when your value goes above 21. Hit means to draw a card and when
you're happy, stand to proceed.

Betting, double downs, blackjacks, etc have not been implemented yet.

* Lunar Lander

The aim of Lunar Lander is to land your spaceship safely (touching the ground at
a velocity of 0ft/s). Here are the rules that govern your spaceship:

1. After each second, the height, velocity, and remaining fuel
will be reported in the status menu.

2.After each second enter the number of units of fuel you wish to burn during
the next second.

3. Each unit of fuel will slow your descent by 1 foot/sec.

4.The maximum amount of fuel you can burn in one second is 30 units. If you
run out of fuel, you will no longer be prompted to enter the number of units
to burn each second.

You can use the mode key to quit the game any time.

* Chess

Right now there is no board display only the moves displayed in coordinate
fasion (eg d7d5).

Currently there is no way to swap sides, play as black, setup, undo or change
level.

At the start of the game, you play the white pieces. enter your first move
using numbers instead of letters, so A=1, B=2 etc.  for example, the move
E2-E4 is entered as the number 5254. the watch responds and then you make your next move. 

Press mode key to escape.
