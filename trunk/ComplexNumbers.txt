
*** Here are the user instructions and technical info for complex number
    support in the uWatch.

There is no complex mode! the uwatch can perform complex number operations
when present and does not need to be set into a special mode for this. The
calculator's internal functions test for the presence of an ipart in order to
perform the best calculation. importantly, then there is no ipart, the
calculation is xsimpler, fast and in some cases more stable numerically. So
there is no loss of efficiency and precision by not having a mode.

However, the lack of a dedicated mode means that some real number calculations
can result in a complex answer. for example sqrt(-2) and acos(1.2).

** Entry Method:

Enter numbers in the usual way, and initiate the entry of an ipart by pressing
"." either once or twice. When a decimal dot or exponent is already present,
pressing "." will initate the ipart entry. the screen will change to, for
example, "1.2+i" waiting for the ipart entry.

If there is no decimal place already, two "."s are required, for example, to
enter 1+i, enter "1..", you can leave it as +i or enter 1 if you like, both
are acceptable.
