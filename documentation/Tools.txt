* Here are the instructions for the Tools

* Quadratic

Quadratic is a quadratic equation solver which solves equations in this format:
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 given B*B-4*A*C >= 0

Just input the values of a,b and c and the program solves the value of x

*Factor

Factor gets the factor of an integer. Just input the input and the program
will return the factors of that number not including 1 and the number itself.
If there are no factors found, then the program will say it is a prime number.

*Stopwatch

In time mode, MENU will start stopwatch, and C will exit.
Stopwatch can also be started from the Tools menu.

When you press ENTER to start the stopwatch, thre F-key options appear at top...

LAP
This sets a "waypoint" -- so the stopwatch keeps running in the background, but you can see what the time was when you pressed LAP.  It will show [LAP] when displaying the lap time. Press again to go back to normal stopwatch time display.

SPLIT
This tells you the difference between the current time and the last time you pressed LAP.  In other words, it's a split time.  It will display [SPLIT] when showing the split time.  Press again to go back to normal stopwatch time display.

ZERO
This resets the stopwatch count time to 0.

You also press ENTER to halt the stopwatch and exit.
