
Notation

[KEY] indicates the keyboard key with the labeling "KEY"
<KEY> indicates a conceptual key -- just for the purposes of this
documentation to make it more readable.  Where you see <OK> that means
press [ENTER], as clarified in this table...

<QUIT>  = [C]		exit without doing anything
<UP> 	= [)]  		up-scrolling is done by the right bracket key
<DOWN> 	= [MENU] 	down-scrolling is done by the menu key
<OK>    = [ENTER]	selection and exit from menus is done by the enter key

As you can see, these navigation keys occupy the right column of the keyboard.

Although the keys do different things at different times, generally
you hit [MENU] to enable a menu and then [MENU] again to scroll down the
items in the menu.  But it's easier to think of as [MENU] <DOWN>

Navigation

Menus are available from:

TIME mode
CALCULATOR mode
APPLICATIONS mode

To bring up a menu, press [MENU].  The menu title is generally shown on the
top line of the display, and menu options are shown on the bottom line of the
display.  Whenever mutliple menu options are available, the rightmost lower
character in the display displays two little arrows, pointing up and down. These
indicate that you can press <UP> or <DOWN> to display the menu options.

A menu item that begins with an arrow > symbol indicates that that item is
itself a menu containing other items.

Press <OK> to select the currently displayed menu item.

Press <C> or [MODE] to exit from the current menu without making a selection.
<C> will return to the previous mode.
[MODE] will return to TIME mode. 

TIME MENU:

Menu available from TIME mode:

	Calendar
	> Setup

		Set 12/24h
		Set DST Zone
		Set Location
		

In the above example, Setup is a sub-menu containing 6 items.

CALCULATOR MENU:

The calculator has a slightly different menu system, as it uses F-keys
to allow quick selection of functions.  When you press [MENU] in calculator
mode, you will see up to 6 functions displayed on the screen.  These are 
arranged in two lines of three, or two lines of two.

The F1 to F6 keys will select the function displayed in the similar relative
position of the F-key on the keyboard.

As with other menus, <UP> and <DOWN> will cycle through the available menus
and <C> or <OK> will quit with no action.

[MODE] will also return to the calculator.

CHESS:

The Display:

The chessboard display can be scrolled using <UP> and <DOWN>

The white pieces are drawn using a contrasting technique that may be controlled
by using the number keys [1] through [9].  The lower the number, the
blacker the white pieces appear.  The initial contrast level is "5".

<C> or <ENTER> will switch between move entry and board display.

In move entry, the last computer move (if any) is displayed on the top line.

Moves are entered using column number row number format.  For example,
5254 is E2-E4 equivalent.

Illegal moves return to the board display.  Legal moves trigger the 
computer player to search for a reply.

When the computer moves, the board is displayed with the computer move
positioned on the top line of the display.  YOu may switch back and forth
between move entry and board display using <C> or <ENTER>

The game may be discontinued by pressing [MODE] from the board display.

When returning to chess, if a game was previously in progress, an option
to continue or start a new game is presented.
