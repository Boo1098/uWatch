- fixed current date format "st", "rd", "th" sometimes wrong

1.5.0 (zowki's modification)
- The third mode is now apps mode, branching out to tools, games and setup

1.5.5
- added Factor, a tool that gets the factors of a number

1.5.6
- upgraded vchess engine to 1.3

1.5.7 (Andrew Davie's modification)
-- Custom characters for time mode added
- AM/PM defined and offset upwards to make it a bit neater
- used a nice little star for DST
- used two characters for moon phase. (mockup only)
- redefined "st", "nd", "rd", "th" so that they're smaller, raised, and nicer.

--Stopwatch modified
- in time mode, stopwatch can be started by MENU button
  (ie: you don't have to go to the TOOLS menu)
- stopwatch now has lap, split and zero

--LCD fixes and other modifications
- backlight turns on for as long as you hold the RCL button and stays on
  after holding for 4 seconds, press RCL again to turn off
- 12/24 hour mode toggled from time mode by any key
- key presses respond immediately rather than only when released (all modes)
- negative values in stopwatch fixed
- "+/-" key works the same as "+" in menu operations
- display cleaner, no cursor when updating screen
- display update on return from sleep is immediate
  (no more cursor/blackness weirdness)
  
1.5.8
- "twenty one" bug called winner as dealer due to missing "else" -- fixed.
- 2nd in second menus changed to 1st
- Factor optimized
- Key delay increased to 200ms (was too sensitive)
- put in the moonphase glyphs done by Andrew Davie. 
- pattern is now:
   (--) = new
   (^-) = crescent
   (0-) = first quarter
   (0^) = waxing.
   (00) = full
   (0^) = waning
   (-0) = second quarter
   (-^) = final crescent.
   the pattern waxes from the left and wanes on the right. i reflected the quarter glyph to get the other side.

- LCD GRAM (custom characters) restored after sleep mode (no more corrupt characters, ever)
- the DST * now shows when there IS daylight saving, instead of when there ISN'T
- put in a degree symbol in the C and F conversion menus
- put in an arrow character in the same menus
- put neato-characters in math menus (lots)
- changed "1st" back to "2nd" in these menus -- sorry there are two reasons
	- it's completely non-standard to have "1st" -- all calculators have 1 key labeled 2nd
    - there are not enough custom characters to have "st" and "nd" in the menus
    - aligned menu options with f-keys where appropriate
- defined new menu structure component -- an array of custom character pointers
    - this lets you add up to 8 custom characters to any menu screen, and those
	  custom characters are automatically loaded with the menu
      Note the \000 format in the menu strings -- this is OCTAL character # 

1.5.9
- improvements to the vchess game.

1.5.A
- more menu madness.
- added many more individual files and removed the #include for C files inside the main one.  This was bad.
- added header files and resolved all link errors
- now all errors/warnings (none left) are double-clickable in the IDE and you go to the line
- changed project to include new files
- changed gcc compilation option to -Os (space).  This is the only way it fits at the moment.  If you can't compile with this option, comment out some code – suggest one of the games (see the #if 1 in the game code)
- added viewString to show long strings – example in TOOLS/About
- partially fixed the factor tool.  It, too, uses long string output
- replaced the calculator menus with the new menu system
- implemented 'quick-keys' which allow menu selection using the index # of the menu item.
- index number of menu items shown between scroll arrows.  If there's a number there, you can press that number to get the option quickly, even though it may not be the one displayed.
- Added bitwise operators to the calculator menu – AND, OR, XOR, NOT.  These are not functional/tested at the moment... some may work.
- fixed up character glitching on startup
- put in backlight operation on calculator more.  STO/RCL key is multiplexed, so we don't lose that key :)
- added “cards” characters / hearts/clubs/spades/diamonds
- added generic menu-drawing and selection code – see genericMenu2 and to a lesser extent genericMenu
- changed the HEX digit input to a menu-system.  Note that quick-keys works for this, too.

1.5.B
- added auto-scrolling (hold direction down) to viewMenu. See VIEW_* equates in menu.h for control
- added KeyEXP equivalent to ) and - for menu control.  It's to the left of MENU, it makes logical
  sense for it to function this way;  several times I pressed it accidentally before
  realising I really should include the key... it does no harm.
- added new string display to output of quadratic() tool
- added early-abort (C key and MODE key) to factor() tool. If C pressed, partial result displayed.
- added speed of light (m/s) and Avogadro's number to constants

1.6.0
  NEW OFFICIAL RELEASE

1.6.0.1
- added modulus function, replaced duplicate y^x entry in menu
  This seems to be a pretty naieve implementation, but better than nothing.
- timeout reset on wakeup, so it doesn't retrigger immediately (sometimes)
