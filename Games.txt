* Chess

Right now there is no board display only the moves displayed in coordinate
fasion (eg d7d5).

Currently there is no way to swap sides, play as black, setup, undo or change
level.

At the start of the game, you play the white pieces. enter your first move
using numbers instead of letters, so A=1, B=2 etc.  for example, the move
E2-E4 is entered as the number 5254. the watch responds and then you make your next move. 

Press mode key to escape.
